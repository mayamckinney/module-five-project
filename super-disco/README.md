# Work Day Scheduler Starter

## How to Use

Using this scheduler is quite simple. Based on the time of day, the scheduler will grey out certain blocks in order to let the user know that the time has passed. Red blocks show the current hour of the day, and green blocks show the hours to come. Simply enter in your task or appointment on the block, then click the save button in order to save the content on the page. It will remain there until it is changed. That simple!
